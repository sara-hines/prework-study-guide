# University of Denver Full Stack Bootcamp Prework Study Guide: Introduction to HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript

## Description

This project is a web page created to act as a study guide for University of Denver's Full Stack Bootcamp. Learning to code is an intensive process involving a deluge of new information to absorb and skills to acquire, which creates a need for organizational tools along the way. This study guide is designed to be both a practice ground for foundational HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript tasks and concepts, as well as a platform to review and study notes in an organized manner. In summary, the Prework Study Guide is one solution to the problem of needing a platform to learn, practice, and study foundational coding skills while building competency in HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

While creating the Prework Study Guide, I learned:
* how to use Git and GitHub to track changes to code; to ensure only clean, quality code is committed; to allow a return to an earlier version of code before a bug was introduced; and to allow efficient collaboration on teams while preventing merge conflicts
* how to create a new repository; clone a repository to work locally; create GitHub Issues; set up a directory with starter code; create a feature branch; stage and commit changes; push changes to a remote branch; create and merge a pull request to the main branch; and deploy to GitHub Pages
* how to add the following element types in HTML: text, image, header, list, meta-related elements, content division elements, and semantic elements
* the basis of HTML, CSS, and Javascript syntax
* how to use VS Code and Open with Live Server to view the impact of changes made to code 
* how to use CSS to style HTML elements by creating a CSS file, linking an external CSS style sheet to the HTML file, adding style through class attributes, and complete the Git flow
* how to use variables, functions, conditional logic, arrays, and for loops in JavaScript to add interactivity to the Chrome DevTools Console
* at a broad level, how to develop a project following a user story and acceptance criteria, testing and making changes iteratively until the project requirments are met

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide contains four sections in order to organize notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. These sections can be reviewed and compared to better understand the distinct uses of each of these tools, as well as some of the fundamentals involved in code for the particular tool. Additionally, when using the Chrome DevTools Console, a list of the topics in the prework can be viewed, as well as the question, "Which topic should we study first?" and subsequently a randomly selected topic that is suggested to study.
